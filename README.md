-	Alerts: A notification will appear for that task for that day(reminders)
-	Recurring tasks: Recurring tasks on certain days set by the user
-	Color Task: The user will be able to color-code their different tasks
-	Email reminders: The app will send email alerts about upcoming events/tasks set by the user
